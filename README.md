# go-rest-starter
This is a boiler plate code for a basic rest API in Golang. The gin package has been used to provide server services to the applications.

# Key Features
- Production level extendible project structure
- Proper Logging and Middlewares included
- Custom Error handling done
- Good use of interfaces, polymorphism, and other OOP concepts
- Can be extended to include multiple entities


# How to run
- Install Golang into your system ( I have used version 1.21.1 )
- Go to the directory having main.go file by ```cd cmd/service```
- run ```go run``` .
- This will start the server locally on port 8000 (Make sure any other application does not use that port)
